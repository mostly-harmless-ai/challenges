As such, there is no real exercise here. We will focus instead on learning the workflow for participating on a task, submitting your code, and getting it evaluated. Prerequisites To participate in this task you'll just need a standard installation of Python. Instructions for installing Python in multiple in architectures is available on their website . Additionally, you'll need to create a Github account , and install Git on your terminal. These prerequisites are the minimum necessary for every other challenge. Setting up the coding environment Navigate to this task's repository in Github . On the top right corner of the main window you'll see a button titled Fork ; click on it. Now follow the instructions and you'll have your own copy of the challenge in your own Github namespace. Once forked, you can clone your own copy of the repository. If your Github username is user , you can achieve this by typing the following on a terminal: git clone https://github.com/user/task-hello-world Now you can open this folder on your desired editor. You should see a Readme.md file with these same instructions, and some other files we'll go over in a minute. It's time to set up your coding environment. The first step will be to create a separate virtual environment. This will ensure that whatever library you need to install for this specific task will not mess up with your standard Python installation. If you don't know what is a virtual environment or how to create one, you can read more here . Once you're safely inside your isolated environment, you can install the dependencies for this task by typing the following in the terminal, while located on the root folder of the task~(the one that contains the Readme.md file). pip install -r requirements.txt \ud83d\udcdd If you prefer a different way of isolating your environment~(e.g., using Docker, conda environments, pyenv, Poetry, etc.) you are free to do so as well. Task description Now you're ready to start hacking your solution! In a real task, this is the point where you do all the heavy work. In this task, though, since we're only concerned with learning the workflow, we crafted a silly exercise for you. Open hello_world.py and modify the method called answer so that it reads: def answer(): return 42 That's it! Bonus points if you get the joke \ud83d\ude06. Checking your code If you installed the required dependencies, you should be able to run: pytest And get a pretty green message saying everything is OK!","title":"Hello World"},{"location":"tasks/hello-world/#hello-world","text":"The purpose of this task is to get you started with the setup necessary for participating in the remaining challenges.
